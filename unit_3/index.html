		<p> We source all our meat from small, British farmers.
		And it’s always native-breed, free range, pasture fed meat, which we dry age ourselves in Bermondsey. 
		We buy our meat directly from small farms or in conjunction with Traditional Breeds Meat Market. Dealing directly wiht farmers ensures a fair price for them and guarantees qulait and provenance. So we’re not only being environmentally and economically sustainable, we know exactly where our meat comes from and how it’s reared. We’re always happy to tell you – so just ask.</p>

		<p>We buy and butcher the whole carcass.
		We only buy whole animal carcasses and butcher them the traditional way – from tongue to tail. By doing things this way, we can check the meat as a whole, see what cuts are best suited to the animal and butcher it accordingly. And, of course, this practice means we use the animal in the most efficient way possible, which helps the farmers, too.</p>

	<h4>The way we see it is, if you’re going to kill an animal, why not use all of it?
